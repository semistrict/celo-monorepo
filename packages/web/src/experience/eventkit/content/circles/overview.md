### Branding
Celo Circle members are not cLabs or Celo Foundatoin employees, contractors, or representatives. They are independent, volunteer community members who share a passion for Celo and the mission of prosperity for all. Make Celo your own!
We are creating Celo Community Branding assets to localize the Celo logo with your own Celo Circle flair.
